üöÄ Here is a working live site: [awwwards.markaustria.com](https://awwwards.markaustria.com/)

## üìù Description

Welcome to my Award-Worthy Gaming Website project! This is an immersive gaming experience with advanced animations.

Many developers believe that visually impressive, award-winning websites require large teams and complex implementations. This project aimed to disprove that myth by creating a website with the same level of polish and interactivity as those winning design awards, but built by a single developer.

The project showcases advanced frontend techniques while maintaining excellent performance across all devices. It recreates the immersive experience of Zentry.com, a metagame platform with unique animations and interactions, while ensuring performance and responsiveness aren't compromised.

Immersive animations, interactive elements, and responsive design that works on all devices.

**Technologies Used:** React, Vite, GSAP, Tailwind CSS

## ‚ú® Features

- **Immersive Video Hero Section:** Full-screen video background with an interactive mini-player that allows users to switch between different video scenes with smooth zoom transitions, creating an engaging entry point to the website.
- **Interactive 3D Tilt Effects:** Custom 3D tilt effects for cards and images using JavaScript and GSAP, creating an interactive experience where elements respond to cursor movement without relying on external libraries.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Complex scroll-triggered animations using GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin, including text reveals, image transitions, and section transformations that enhance the storytelling aspect of the website.
- **Smart Navigation System:** A responsive navigation that adapts to scroll direction and background content, tracking scroll direction using the react-use library's useWindowScroll hook.
